Basic website to show my CV as of now , 
i want to update this to show my personal staement , CV and python projects , but seeing as i have just started learning HTML and CSS as of about just over a week ago , (with some prior research in spare time over summer to get ahead) this is very basic, but 
this is what i aim to include once i am farmiliar with how to do so and i will be researching this in hope to have this doen for NOV(ish) for applications needing a CV .
