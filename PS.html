    <h3>PERSONAL STATEMENT - last updated 19/09/24</h3>
    <p>&ensp;</p>

    <p>Throughout my academic journey, my aspiration for Computer Science has shown me that Technology requires creativity, problem-solving, evolution and resilience.  My journey has been challenging but immensely rewarding, and these qualities are now second nature to me which will allow me to thrive at university and in a professional environment, where I can further develop my knowledge to enable me to make an impact in the industry.</p>
    <p>This aspiration has deepened as I have spent more time studying and improving my skills such as abstract thinking and problem-solving, which I believe set me apart and will help me excel in this ever-evolving field. I have honed these abilities through various practical projects, such as coding an ATM machine, a hotel safe, calculators, and dice/random number-based games for practice in my spare time. Most recently, I developed a blackjack game with a GUI for my A-Level coursework which have significantly refined my programming skills, exposing me to new algorithms and data structures of which I have incorporated into subsequent projects.</p>
    <p>Fred Brooks in his book ‘The Mythical Man Month’ expressed the importance of wisdom, communication, adaptability and learning from successes and failures. This is something I am familiar with in my studies, whether it be presenting a team project in front of my A-Level Business class, analysing and evaluating events and situations critically for my History course, or my Computer Science coursework, which consistently presents challenges of which I learn and adapt to. Embracing these values has allowed me to approach my studies with a growth mindset, transforming challenges into opportunities for learning and improvement. </p>
    <p>I proactively sought work experience to develop my knowledge by completing a week-long virtual placement with TATA Consultancy Services where I attended daily talks and workshops on topics like innovation in tech, creative thinking, UI/UX design. This helped me broaden my view of the implementation of technology in everyday tasks and the importance of attention to detail. During this programme, I was tasked with designing and presenting an app based on the Sustainable Development Goal of Reduced Inequalities. My app "EqualOpportunity" was designed to create an anonymous job application process with the tagline and aim to "Break bias, build careers" and my presentation received very positive feedback and earned me a certificate from TATA.</p>
    <p>I participated in Amazon AI Cloud Solutions, Barclays LifeSkills, and Fujitsu Quantum Computing programs, where I deepened my understanding of new, cutting-edge technologies. During the Amazon AI Cloud Solutions programme, I explored cloud-based machine learning models, focusing on the use of neural networks to optimise data processing and decision-making. I also tackled AI-powered customer service solutions through integration of natural language processing models to enhance chat bots’ ability to understand context and information, improving accuracy and client satisfaction. During Fujitsu's Quantum Computing program, I explored the potential of quantum algorithms to solve complex problems in areas like optimisation and cryptography, which can be done at speeds impossible even for super-computers. I gained an understanding of how quantum systems could be used to tackle issues that are challenging for generic computers, such as improving supply chain logistics or enhancing data security. This experience gave me a practical insight into the future applications of quantum computing and its potential across industries.</p>
    <p>These highlighted the importance of creativity and innovative thinking in driving technological advancements. It was astonishing to see how complex yet impactful these technologies are, motivating me to be part of this technological evolution. These experiences have deepened my desire to contribute to the future of technological innovation, and I am eager to continue developing my skills in this area.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy practicing my programming skills through personal projects such as working on improving the aesthetics of my blackjack game by designing and creating a GUI in Python. This has involved experimenting with various algorithms and data structures such as queues, stacks and lists to optimise its performance and realism. Additionally, I developed an interactive HTML and CSS website to showcase my CV and projects, refining my web development skills by testing different layouts and incorporating media to display my work. I have built multiple computers for myself and clients, and while on this work experience, I used my knowledge of hardware components to identify the best performance-to-cost ratio, then source, assemble, and configure the systems to meet their specifications. This helped focus on honing my ability to explain complex technical concepts and collaborate with others, and this skill proved to be vital during this work experience, for example explaining intricate technical ideas to those with less experience, working in a team, and pitching innovative ideas. </p>
    <p>Beyond technology, I am also passionate about sports, particularly football, on which I am currently completing an EPQ on commercialisation of football. My EPQ has required lots of critical thinking to devise a sufficient plan, and resilience to find relevant research and write evaluatively. I have captained my school and local Collier Row FC teams for multiple years, which my leadership skills on and off the field have been instrumental in organising and motivating the team.  My captaincy has allowed me to thrive in pressured environments and has strengthened my resilience, critical-thinking, and communication skills.</p>
    <p>I believe that a degree in Computer Science will provide me with the further knowledge, experience, and opportunities to turn my desire into a successful career. I am ready and prepared to take on the challenges and opportunities that this path presents and I am looking forward to contributing to and learning from the vibrant, flourishing community which I hope to join.</p>
