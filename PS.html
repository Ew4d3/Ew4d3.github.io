    <h3>PERSONAL STATEMENT</h3>
    <p> &emsp; </p>

    <p>My desire to study computer science has been present throughout my whole academic journey, and has only grown since studying computer science at GCSE level. This journey has been challenging but immensely rewarding, I am excited by the future opportunities that a degree in Computer Science will open to me. I am eager to immerse myself in the field and I am confident that my love for computer science along with my problem-solving abilities, abstract thinking, and communication skills, will allow me to thrive in a university and working environment. I hope that with these skills I can further develop my knowledge to enable me to make an impact in the industry.</p>

    <p>This desire for computer science has deepened as I have had more years studying this subject and improving my skills, of which I believe make me stand out and allow me to thrive in the evolving world of computer science. A few essential skills in my venture of computer science have been my ability to think abstractly and solve problems. I have developed these abilities through challenges faced during my practical experiences, for example projects consisting of coding an ATM machine, hotel safe, calculators, dice/random number-based games for practice/fun and my most recent project, a blackjack game with a GUI for my A-Level Coursework.</p>
        
    <p>I proactively sought work experience to develop my knowledge within the field , of which I completed week-long virtual work experience with TATA Consultancy Services where I participated in various talks and workshops daily such as innovation in tech, design thinking, UI/UX design, impact of tech in finance, and how to pitch a product. During this program I was tasked with designing and presenting an App based on the sustainable development goal of Reduced Inequalities. My app “EqualOppourtunity” was designed to create an anonymous job application process , to “break bias, build careers”. This earned me a certificate from TCS and I got very positive feedback. </p>
        
    <p>My work experiences with TCS and other programs, including those in software engineering, Amazon AI, Barclays LifeSkills, and Amazon Cloud Solutions not only vastly expanded my knowledge in areas such as the cloud and AI, but also enabled me to analyse and evaluate my ideas and be more efficient in my working by providing us with many problems to solve throughout and helping us reach the desired outcome of our projects effectively, making me an overall more confident and capable candidate overall. All of these have emphasised the need for clear communication skills , and Communication is a skill that I have focused on though frequent presentations Infront of my A level business class, practicing for my Jack Petchey Foundation speech Infront of an audience and presenting research based on a Geography trip. This skill is essential, whether its explaining complex technical concepts to people with less experience, collaborating as a team or pitching new effective ideas.</p> 
        
    <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of these work experiences was seeing how technology is used to combat real life problems. For example, the sessions on AI and cloud solutions from amazon showed how new tech are transforming industries and our lives as a whole, which astonished how complex but beautiful these new technologies are, and motivates me to get involved and be a part of this tech evolution. I was very inspired by the innovation in tech session from TCS  which explained the importance of creativity and forward thinking, showing to be a catalyst for technological advancement. These experiences deepened my desire to be involved in future technological innovation, and I am eager to continue developing my skills in these areas. </p>
        
    <p>My hobbies consist of practising programming skills through projects such as designing and creating a GUI in python to improve the aesthetic of my blackjack game and creating a website to display my CV and projects. I have built multiple computers for myself and others, by having them explain to me their intended use for it, analysing this and suggesting parts, finding, buying, building and setting it up for them to use as intended. I am also interested in and play various sports, my favourite being football. I have played for various teams, captaining my school and external team for multiple years. My leadership shown on the field and eagerness to collaborate tactically was a valuable asset used by my managers to help organise the team and motivate them to play in the intended way. </p>

    <p>I believe that further education in computer science will provide me with the knowledge, experience, and opportunities to turn my desire into a successful career . I am ready and prepared to take on the challenges and opportunities that this path presents, and I look forward to contributing to and learning from the vibrant, flourishing community that I hope to join.</p>
