    <h3>PERSONAL STATEMENT - last updated 19/09/24</h3>
    <p>&ensp;</p>

    <p>My desire to study Computer Science has been a present throughout my whole academic journey , and it has only grown since studying the subject at GCSE level . This journey has been challenging , but also immensely rewarding and I am excited by the future opportunities that a degree in Computer Science will open to me. I am eager to immerse myself in the field and am confident that my passion, combined with my problem-solving abilities , abstract thinking , and communication skills , will allow me to thrive at university and in a professional environment . I hope that with these skills I can further develop my knowledge to enable me to make an impact in the industry .</p>
    <p>This aspiration has deepened as I have spent more time studying and improving my skills, which I believe set me apart and will help me excel in this ever-evolving field. Among the essential skills I have developed are abstract thinking and problem-solving . I have honed these abilities through various practical projects, such as coding an ATM machine, a hotel safe, calculators, and dice/random number-based games for practice in my spare time. Most recently, I developed a blackjack game with a GUI for my A-Level coursework . These projects have significantly refined my programming skills , exposing me to new algorithms and data structures of which I’ve incorporated into subsequent projects .</p>        
    <p>I proactively sought work experience to develop my knowledge within the field , and I completed a week-long virtual placement with TATA Consultancy Services, where I attended daily talks and workshops on topics like innovation in tech , design thinking , UI/UX design , and the impact of technology on finance. During this program, I was tasked with designing and presenting an app based on the Sustainable Development Goal of Reduced Inequalities. My app , "EqualOpportunity ," was designed to create an anonymous job application process with the tagline and aim to "Break bias , build careers ." This presentation earned me a certificate from TCS , and I received very positive feedback, particularly on my creativity and presentation skills .</p>        
    <p>In addition to my time with TCS , I participated in other programs , including Amazon AI and cloud solutions , Barclays LifeSkills , and Fujitsu Quantum Computing. These experiences expanded my knowledge in areas such as cloud computing, machine learning, and quantum computing . They also encouraged me to think critically and efficiently, solving complex challenges like identifying potential use cases for AI and quantum computing in real-world applications such as in a store to help figure out the most efficient way to do something or AI-powered customer service . These experiences have made me a more confident and capable candidate, equipped with the ability to apply my new knowledge and skills effectively .</p>        
    <p>Clear communication is another crucial skill I’ve developed through these experiences . Whether presenting in front of my A-Level business class, practicing for my Jack Petchey Foundation speech , or delivering a research-based presentation after a geography field trip , I have focused on honing my ability to explain complex technical concepts and collaborate with others. This skill is vital, whether I’m explaining intricate technical ideas to those with less experience, working in a team , or pitching innovative ideas .</p>        
    <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of my work experiences has been witnessing how technology is used to address real-world problems . For example, Amazon’s sessions on AI and cloud solutions demonstrated how these technologies are transforming industries and daily life as we are often reliant on cloud storage and now becoming dependant on AI to help us work efficiently. I was particularly inspired by TCS’s innovation in tech session, which highlighted the importance of creativity and innovative thinking in driving technological advancements which astonished me how complex but beautiful and useful these new technologies are, and motivates me to get involved and be a part of this tech evolution. These experiences have deepened my desire to contribute to the future of technological innovation, and I am eager to continue developing my skills in this area .</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy practicing my programming skills through personal projects . I have worked on improving the aesthetic of my blackjack game by designing and creating a GUI in Python and experimenting with many algorithms and data structures such as queues, stacks, and lists to optimize its performance and realism. Additionally , I created a website to showcase my CV and projects, refining my web development skills by testing different layouts and adding pages to incorporate pictures displaying my work. I have built multiple computers for myself and clients while on work experience, by having them explain to me their budget and use case, analysing this to get the best performance for their money, then suggesting, finding, buying parts, building and setting it up for them to use as desired. Beyond technology , I am also passionate about sports, especially football , where I have captained my secondary school and local Collier Row FC teams for multiple years. My leadership skills on, and off the field have been instrumental in organizing and motivating the team to play as intended.</p>        
    <p>I believe that a degree in Computer Science will provide me with the further knowledge , experience , and opportunities to turn my desire into a successful career . I am ready and prepared to take on the challenges and opportunities that this path presents and I am looking forward to contributing to and learning from the vibrant , flourishing community which I hope to join .</p>
