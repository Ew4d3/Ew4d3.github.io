        <ul>
            <li><p>This website is the first experience I have with HTML and CSS programming. I used the Pumpkin Pie recipe website as a template for this one at the start, then developed over a week or so to have the theme it does now.
                this required many hours in my evening around school work and sports , but I was so determined to do this and do it well , of which I believe I have. I was always been inspired by Portfolio websites for people seeking senior job roles ,
                showing off previous projects at companies they had worked at , and I knew I wanted to do the same. when we started learning about html and CSS , I knew this was what I was going to do as soon as I had the skills . 
                We had about 2 lessons on this , then summer came around . So, in summer I applied to a html and CSS coding camp , of which I was accepted and spent hours daily learning the formatting , how to make and link pages ,
                how to use CSS to make it look as desired. I was astonished by the limitless possibilities that were now presented to me , and once I had finished my EPQ first draft , I got to work on this immediately . 
                I started this around the 10th of September 2024 and have made significant progress since then , and my knowledge has exponentially grown. </p></li>

        <p>Blackjack Coursework - In Progress</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>This project is a variation the game blackjack, with less stakes and consequences compared to in casinos and online betting websites with real money. Gambling addiction is hugely present in society, and of which the effects of this can be unimaginable. 
            Gambling addiction is a psychological problem which is almost impossible to give up without the help of others. Therefore, this game has been designed to help people suffering with addiction, and with my project I can provide a game where the excitement 
            and euphoric feelings are still present, but without the soul crushing consequences that occur if the cards go the other way. This virtual game with all the same rules, flow of play and design is perfect for this problem, using a fake, virtual currency so 
            the player can still get the satisfaction of seeing their balance rising, but without the catastrophic financial losses that occur in real life if the cards don't turn out the way they want them to. </p></li>

        <uk>
            <li>This ATM was the first and main project for learning how to program using python at GCSE level. many lesson hours were spent trying out and discussing ideas on how to do things , combined with research and telling 
                each other what we had done at home. This project laid the foundations for where I am knowledge wise today , and kickstarted my love for programming. As this was the first project I had done , there is no GUI , but 
                the essential focus for that project was getting familiar with computational thinking and how to structure programs.

        <uk>
            <li>This was my second GCSE project , but couldn’t spend a large amount of time on it as exams were coming up , so isn’t as developed as I would like to be. The aim for this project was to familiarise ourselves with 
                data structures and algorithms , specifically lists , loops and comparisons.

        <ul>
            <li>This task wasn’t a project as such , but one of my first coding tasks , and a task of which I remember specifically I learned a lot from . When I got this working, I was elated and couldn’t stop playing it. Looking back this is a very simple 
                task , but when I was new to programming , this seemed like a colossal problem which required lots of knowledge to solve. I have included this on my site as I feel as if even though it is 
                basic and I could make it better with my skillset now , it is still a fun game to play and experience.
